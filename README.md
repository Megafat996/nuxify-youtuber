Have you ever wanted to always feel like you were going to watch a nuxtaku video? Well this extension adds nuxtaku to youtube thumbnails making you feel at home.

Mostly using code from MagicJinn's Mrbeast extension: https://github.com/MagicJinn/MrBeastify-Youtube?tab=readme-ov-file
MagicJinn's kofi: https://ko-fi.com/magicjinn


To setup this extension without using the firefox or chrome addon store you will first have to download the code as a zip file and follow one of these youtube guides:

Firefox: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqWMDv411k0

For the firefox tutorial instead of loading in the manifest file load in the whole extension as a zip file, do not zip the folder, select all the files and zip them.

Right now there is a bug where if you use the search bar twice it will display the results from the first search and not the second search, this can be fixed by refreshing the page
